# Welcome to KGWRAPS

KGWRAPS (A Knowledge Graph-poWered Research Assistant for Polymer Science) is a collaborative effort between Wright State University and the Air Force Research Lab that seeks to construct an AI agent capable of interacting with polymer scientists in natural language. Its goal is to aid in experimental development and execution, reducing the rote aspects of subject matter experts' workload. By making correlations between polymer properties and structure and experimental conditions, KGWRAPS will have three primary functions:

1. Act as a Source of Truth (SoT) by allowing querying of relevant data,
2. Enable graph analytics by allowing analyses of polymers based on specific properties or environmental conditions, and
3. Identify knowledge gaps and make predictions about the relationships between polymer properties and experimental conditions.
